## Today I Learned..

### What is Shell?
- A program that connects the OS kernel and the user
- Common shells: sh, csh, bash, zsh
- Commands learned: cd, mkdir, touch, rm, cat, etc.

### What is Vim?
- A CLI-based text editor
- Modes: normal, insert, visual, command-line
- Key commands: i, v, ESC, dd, yy, p, :wq, etc.

### Markdown Basics
- Lightweight markup language for formatting text
- Syntax: headers (#), lists (-, 1.), links, images, emphasis (_, **), code blocks

### Git Basics
- A distributed version control system (DVCS)
- Enables offline work, non-linear development with branches
- Developed by Linus Torvalds

### Repository Setup
- Always include README.md for documentation
- Add .gitignore to avoid tracking unnecessary files
- On your first push from a new computer, use a *Personal Access Token* instead of your password
  → Set an expiration date for better security
  → Token setup: https://github.com/settings/tokens

### Git Core Workflow
- git clone: Check if you're in the right directory like dev before cloning
- git status: Always check the current status before adding files
- git add: Stage only necessary files
- git commit: Follow *Conventional Commit* format
  - Prefix: feat, fix, docs, etc.
  - Subject: concise phrase, not a sentence
  - Body: optional if subject is clear enough
- git push: Push to remote after staging and committing

### Git Branching
- Branch = a model that allows independent code paths from a specific point
- Create/switch/merge/delete branches: git branch, git switch, git merge, git branch -D
- Resolve merge conflicts when necessary

## Tomorrow I'll Learn..
- Git Branching Strategy
- Git/GitHub/GitLab Flow
- Issue & Project Management
- Pull Request
- Git Trouble-shooting (stash, restore, reset, revert, etc.)
- Co-work with GitHub
- Final Project overview

## What's interesting..
- It's impressive how powerful and collaborative Git is using just simple CLI commands.
